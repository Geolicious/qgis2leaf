  * Compile the resources file using pyrcc4

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file:
         qgis2leaf.py

  * Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png

  * Modify your user interface by opening qgis2leaf.ui
